# Razer Chroma App Test
Takes an integer representing a BGR colour and sets the keyboard to that colour until the program is quit.

This is a script I was playing with to understand how to work with the Razer Chroma SDK REST API.

## Requirements
- A Razer keyboard with Chroma lighting (tested on Razer Blade Stealth)
- Razer SDK (tested on 2.10) - installed automatically with Razer Synapse
- Python 3
- [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/)
